<h2> Behind Advertype </h2>
<p> This website aims to explore the typography used within the advertisements that we see fequenty on a day to day basis. As a second year
  student of Media, Journalism and Pubishing; the way in which consumers are affected by different techniques is something which I have a key interest in 
  due to my previous studies in sociology and written language.

<h2> Hobbies and Interets </h2>
<p> Before moving to Oxford for Univerisity, I lived in a small town along the east coast in Norfolk where I enjoyed spending time exploring the different beaches close by.
  In my spare time, I enjoy dog training both in agility and obedience; I frequently attend a local club where I train my three dogs: Simba, Jana (who are both border collies)
  and Parker, who is a deaf boxer which we rescued last year. During summer I usually try to 
  to travel to new places or spend as much time as possible attempting to paddle board and surf in Devon and Cornwall.

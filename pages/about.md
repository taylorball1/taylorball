In the current post-modern era, the world revolves around consumerism. As a result there is a constant battle between brands to promote their products over their competitors. Whether its restaurants, apps, clothing stores, television shows or supermarkets, businesses are fighting for our attention and the best way they do that is through advertising. 

Therefore, this website aims to explore the typography used within the advertising industry. It will look at how the use of typography by brands has evolved over time, how this compares to other advertisers and ultimately the effect this has on consumers. 

Picture a "**for sale**" or "**closing down...everything must go**" sign in a shop window, or brand logos such as *KFC, Coca-Cola, Levis and Netflix;* what do they all have in common? The red and white colour theme with the bold typography, which is often found in a block capital sans serif font, is what has inspired many of the visual elements of this website such as the logo and banner image. Enticing ads are a prominent part in our everyday lives; and so these features (the bright colours and capitalisation in various shapes and styles) are elements that we are all familiar with, so it seemed fitting to replicate this onto the website in order to demonstrates the effect that typography has on us as consumers and how we are often unaware of how similar different brands advertising techniques are.  

No brand is off limits, so join me through the journey of advertising typography!

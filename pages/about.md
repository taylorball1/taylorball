In the current post-modern era, the world revolves around consumerism. As a result there is a constant battle between brands to promote their products over their competitors. Whether its restaurants, apps, clothing stores, television shows or supermarkets, businesses are fighting for our attention and the best way they do that is through advertising. 

Therefore, this website aims to explore the typography used within the advertising industry. It will look at how the use of typography by brands has evolved over time, how this compares to other advertisers and ultimately the effect this has on consumers. 

Picture a "**for sale**" or "**closing down...everything must go**" sign in a shop window 

No brand is off limits, so join me through the journey of advertising typography!
